Whipped this together in about 1.5 hours for some friends before the 2023 March Madness Tournament
Surprisingly of my 5 brackets on ESPN, the one generated by this program performed the best of my brackets, It's still not very good though.
Done in Visual Studio.
Currently working on a better version in Python for the upcoming tournament.
